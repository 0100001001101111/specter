## Executive Summary

SPECTER Phase 1 analyzed **745 paranormal reports** in Oregon, 
with focus on the Portland metropolitan area. The analysis correlated these reports 
with **1000 infrastructure points** and 
**381 historical events**.

## Key Findings

### Spatial Clustering

- **8 spatial clusters** identified
- Statistical significance: p = 0.0000
- **SIGNIFICANT**: Reports cluster more than expected by chance

**Top Report Clusters:**
  1. portland: 133 reports (1973 - 2014)
  2. beaverton: 24 reports (1962 - 2013)
  3. hillsboro: 14 reports (1999 - 2014)
  4. lake oswego: 10 reports (1995 - 2013)
  5. oregon city: 9 reports (1995 - 2014)

### Feature Correlations

**Significant Correlations Found:**
- **historical_events**: Reports are closer than random (p=0.0000, d=20.14)
- **historical_natural_disaster**: Reports are closer than random (p=0.0000, d=18.63)

### Temporal Patterns

- Night reports: 63.8% (expected: 37.5%)
  - **SIGNIFICANT**: Non-uniform time distribution
- Full moon reports: 14.2% (expected: 25%)
  - Elevated full moon activity observed
- Seasonal pattern detected: peaks in Aug, Apr, Jul

### Convergence Hotspots

- **64 hotspot locations** identified
- High convergence (score > 0.6): 1
- Multi-factor hotspots (3+ indicators): 0

**Top Hotspots:**
  1. (45.5200, -122.6800) - Score: 1.000
  2. (45.6000, -122.6000) - Score: 0.453
  3. (45.6800, -122.2600) - Score: 0.331
  4. (45.6000, -122.6800) - Score: 0.306
  5. (45.4800, -122.8000) - Score: 0.117

## Data Summary

### Paranormal Reports by Type
- ufo_uap: 745

### Infrastructure Data
- cell_tower: 925
- substation: 75

## Methodology

1. **Spatial Clustering**: DBSCAN and HDBSCAN with haversine distance metric
2. **Feature Correlation**: Permutation testing (n=1000) comparing actual vs random point distributions
3. **Temporal Analysis**: Chi-square tests against uniform distributions
4. **Hotspot Detection**: Multi-layer scoring combining report density and proximity to features

## Limitations

- Population density not fully controlled (reports correlate with where people live)
- Geocoding precision varies (city-level for many reports)
- Historical data incomplete (NUFORC scraping blocked, limited newspaper access)
- Temporal data sparse (many reports lack exact times)

## Conclusions

**Scenario B: Environmental Correlations Found**

Reports show significant correlation with: **historical_events, historical_natural_disaster**. 
This suggests environmental factors may influence paranormal experiences. 
Recommended: Deploy monitoring equipment at high-correlation locations.
