# SPECTER Phase 5: Anomaly-Geology Correlation Analysis

## Executive Summary

We tested whether six categories of anomalous phenomena cluster on piezoelectric (low-magnetic) geology like SPECTER UFO hotspots do. **None of them do.** The UFO-geology correlation appears unique.

## Methodology

Following the Phase 4 checklist:
- Each phenomenon compared to APPROPRIATE null model (not uniform random)
- Bonferroni correction across all 18 tests (α = 0.00278)
- Pre-defined parameters (low-mag threshold = 100 nT)
- Same standards applied to all phenomena

## Results Summary

| Phenomenon | N | Low-Mag % | Mean (nT) | Direction | Survives Bonferroni |
|------------|---|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **SPECTER UFO hotspots** | ~490 | **85%** | **~30** | LOW | **YES (reference)** |
| Earthlights | 15 | 13% | 137 | HIGH | NO |
| High Strangeness Zones | 11 | 9% | 218 | HIGH | YES (opposite direction) |
| Missing 411 Clusters | 12 | 33% | 84 | neutral | NO |
| The Hum Locations | 7 | 0% | -47 | neutral | NO |
| Sacred Sites | 15 | 33% | 61 | neutral | NO |
| Haunting Hotspots | 15 | 47% | 59 | neutral | NO |

## Key Findings

### 1. HIGH STRANGENESS ZONES - Unexpected Result

**Survives Bonferroni, but OPPOSITE direction from SPECTER**

- Mean magnetic: 217.7 nT (vs null model 25.1 nT)
- Only 9.1% in low-mag zones
- Cohen's d = 0.92 (large effect)
- p < 0.002 (survives correction)

These locations (Skinwalker Ranch, Sedona, Bridgewater Triangle, etc.) cluster on **HIGH magnetic** geology - the opposite of UFO hotspots. This is a statistically significant finding but suggests a different mechanism entirely.

Notable: Sedona "vortexes" show 626.4 nT - extremely high magnetic anomaly.

### 2. EARTHLIGHTS - Weak Evidence

**Fails Bonferroni correction**

- Mean magnetic: 137.4 nT
- Only 13.3% in low-mag zones
- p = 0.003 (fails Bonferroni α = 0.00278)

Earthlight locations show HIGHER magnetic values than wilderness baseline. This contradicts the piezoelectric hypothesis for these lights. Brown Mountain (63.5 nT) and Yakima (-0.2 nT) are exceptions.

### 3. MISSING 411 CLUSTERS - No Signal

- 33.3% in low-mag zones (similar to National Park baseline)
- No statistically significant difference from random parkland
- Whatever drives these disappearance clusters, it's not geology

### 4. THE HUM - No Signal

- 0% in low-mag zones
- Mean: -46.7 nT
- No correlation with piezoelectric terrain
- Locations like Taos (NM) actually on moderate magnetic terrain

### 5. SACRED SITES - No Signal

- 33.3% in low-mag zones (similar to mountain baseline)
- Native American sacred mountains are not preferentially piezoelectric
- Selection likely based on prominence/visibility, not geology

### 6. HAUNTING HOTSPOTS - No Signal

- 46.7% in low-mag zones (similar to historic site baseline)
- Haunted locations show no geological preference
- Persinger's tectonic strain theory not supported by this data

## Comparison to SPECTER UFO Data

| Metric | SPECTER UFOs | Other Phenomena |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Low-mag clustering | 85% | 0-47% |
| Mean magnetic | ~30 nT | 59-218 nT |
| Survives Bonferroni | YES | Only high-strangeness (opposite direction) |
| Similar to random baseline | NO (highly elevated) | YES (all except high-strangeness) |

**The UFO-geology correlation is UNIQUE among tested phenomena.**

## Effect Survival Ladder

```
Level 0: Raw correlation observed
Level 1: Survives appropriate null model (p<0.05)
Level 2: Survives Bonferroni correction
Level 3: Effect size meaningful (|d| > 0.5)
Level 4: Replicable (needs independent data)

Results:
- High Strangeness: Level 3 (but OPPOSITE direction - high magnetic)
- Earthlights: Level 1 (fails Bonferroni)
- Missing 411: Level 0
- The Hum: Level 0
- Sacred Sites: Level 0
- Hauntings: Level 0
```

## Honest Conclusions

### What This Analysis Shows

1. **UFO-geology correlation is unique** - No other tested phenomenon shows the same low-magnetic clustering

2. **High strangeness zones cluster on HIGH magnetic terrain** - The opposite of UFOs. This is a real statistical signal that warrants separate investigation.

3. **Earthlights don't cluster on piezoelectric geology** - Despite theoretical predictions, documented spook light locations are mostly in high-magnetic areas

4. **Most anomalies show no geological signal** - Missing 411, The Hum, sacred sites, and hauntings are geologically random

### What This DOESN'T Show

- Doesn't prove UFO-geology connection is causal
- Doesn't rule out confounds we haven't tested
- Small sample sizes limit confidence
- Location data quality varies

### Implications

1. **For SPECTER**: The UFO-geology finding gains credibility by being unique. If everything clustered on low-magnetic terrain, it would suggest a confounder. The specificity is evidence for the effect being real.

2. **For High Strangeness**: The opposite clustering (high magnetic) suggests these locations may involve different mechanisms - perhaps iron deposits, volcanic activity, or other geological features that create anomalous conditions.

3. **For Other Phenomena**: No geological investigation path suggested by this data.

## Data Quality Notes

- Earthlights: Well-documented, some with scientific studies
- High Strangeness: Mixed documentation quality
- Missing 411: Paulides' coordinates may have uncertainty
- The Hum: Several non-US locations excluded (outside grid)
- Sacred Sites: Historical documentation generally reliable
- Hauntings: Selection bias toward TV-investigated sites
